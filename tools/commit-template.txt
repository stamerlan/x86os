# With Add, Mod(ify), Ref(actoring), Fix, Rem(ove) and Rea(dability) then it's 
# easy to extract logfile.
#
# Example :
#
# Add: New function to rule the world.  
# Mod: Add women factor in Domination.ruleTheWorld().  
# Ref: Extract empathy stuff to an abstract class.  
# Fix: RUL-42 or #42 Starvation need to be initialised before Energy to avoid 
# the nullpointer in People.  
# Rem: freeSpeech is not used anymore.  
# Rea: Removed old TODO and extra space in header.
